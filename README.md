# Ultrarogue
### Ultrakill deck-building roguelite zombie shooter
Ultrarogue is a game where you have to survive endless procedurally generated waves of zombies using your gun. At the end of every wave you get to pick a card which can give you new abilities, buff up some stats, nerf the enemies, and more. WASD to move, Left click or space to shoot, f11 to fullscreen, number keys to pick cards, everything else is explained ingame. More content is going to be added later including bossfights, relics, achievements, a skill tree, a starting weapon shop, a travelling merchant, and many new cards and enemies. If the game is too difficult, all i can say is skill issue. The game is very well optimized and includes an interpolation system for fps unlocking and visual smoothing.
